[TODO LIST]
- Implement Controller/Action
- Validation framework
- ORM and a single EntityManager
- Implement other HTTP methods like PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, etc.
- We can be able to use lower case URLs.
  For example; /c/news this should make an object from NewsController class.
  Another example; /c/news/ADD this should call addGet or addPost from NewsController class.
